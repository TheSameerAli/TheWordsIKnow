# All the Words I Know Game

Live at: thewordsiknow.sameerali941.now.sh

## Overview
A simple word game to test your English vocabulary!
The rules are simple:
 - Enter as many english words you know
 - Do not repeat the same word twice
 - Get as many words out in the least possible time

_This project is based on https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas/issues/204_ pitched by @xenotropic. The idea is based on the a facebook post by author-editor Nathan J. Robinson which states:
> In order to relax I am writing a document called All The Words I Know (In The Order I Think Of Them), in which I try to list every word I know . . . It gets harder and harder as you go on of course and realize that you've already used lots of words. I realize this may be a strange way to unwind but people do sudoku and stuff and this doesn't feel much different to me . . . . it gets harder and harder to find ones you haven't used . . . . i bet one could write a simple program that would turn duplicates red or something if one knew how to do such things.
